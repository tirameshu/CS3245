Polaris [English] - Aimer

On that day I decided to protect you,
That promise still remains in my heart...

Even if I must lose everything I have
To save a life in front of me
I'd be happy to give it all without a doubt
This is the first time I've ever felt
I won't hide my scars anymore
Making the despair as my weapon,
That's how I want to live my life!

Push aside these tears the best as I can
I'll give you everything that I have
So please don't give up on me and disappear
On that day I decided to protect you,
That promise still remains in my heart...

The reason I am still alive and fighting now
Was because someone else risked their life for me
I am not afraid of losing anymore
'Cuz I don't want to give up winning

I'll never runaway ever again
I just wanna be the person I wanna be
Even if this is meaningless to everyone else
I am fine as long as I can see you smile

True strength is not about for standing at the top
It's for being able to protect and hold on to your dear ones

Even if I must lose everything
I'll never ever forget about you

Push aside these tears the best as I can
I'll give you everything that I have
So please don't give up on me and disappear
On that day I decided to protect you,
That promise still remains in my heart...
Even if the light is fading away, Just Go!
