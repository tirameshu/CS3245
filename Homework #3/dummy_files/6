Sweet Disposition - The Temper Trap

Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love
A dream, aloud
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
Songs of desperation
I played them for you
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
A moment, a love
A dream aloud
Stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
won't stop 'til it's over
(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop 'til it's over
(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop 'til it's over
(A moment, a love)
(A dream aloud)
(A kiss, a cry)
(Our rights, our wrongs) won't stop to surrender
